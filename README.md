# DSA-project

This project is for coursework purposes.
A method is proposed to select Charge Current Quasi-Elastic (CCQE) 
interactions in Long Baseline Neutrino Experiments.

Selection: 
> There is 1 proton and 0 pions in the final state.
> The momentum of the hit neutron is less than 300 MeV.

Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Dense Neural Network (DNN)
are used to check the quality of the Selection.

For the event generation and analysis, GENIE and NuWro are used.
